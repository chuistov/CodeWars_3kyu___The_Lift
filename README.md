# CodeWars_3kyu___The_Lift
A simple lift control system. Lift delivers passengers up and down.

Hi, everyone!
This is a solution to a problem from codewars.com. 
You need to implement a lift control system so that the lift takes all passengers to the floors. 
Each passenger presses the "up" or "down" button. There is a queue of passengers on each floor 
(those going down do not prevent those going up from entering the car, and vice versa). 
If the car is full, it still stops at the floor where the passenger who pushed the button in the opposite direction is waiting.
